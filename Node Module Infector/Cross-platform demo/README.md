# Node Modules Infector

## This is a poc of how you can infect node modules and execute code every time the application that uses them start. 

#### Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application on the basis of their related functionality. Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders. Node modules can be found in almost every electron application such as ( discord, nzxt, slack, signal, vscode, etc.). 

##### I have created a reverse tcp payload just for the poc but you can inject what ever you want as long as its nodejs code.
